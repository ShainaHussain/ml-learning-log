## 🧠 My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my learning journey in Machine Learning (ML). Here, I transform theoretical concepts into hands-on implementations — building projects, exploring datasets, and improving my coding and analytical skills every week.

This repo is a reflection of my growth as an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer: from learning algorithms in class to applying them on real-world datasets, and understanding the complete ML workflow.

## 🌟 My Journey So Far

-Started with core ML concepts like Regression, Classification, and Clustering.

-Practiced data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering.

-Built mini-projects to consolidate learning: predicting house prices, customer churn, and more.

-Explored evaluation metrics and model optimization.

-Documented every step to create a reproducible, real-world workflow.
